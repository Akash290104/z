<p style="font-size:150%;">I thought that I would be completely free at college with very less assignments and most of the time I would be enjoying with friends. But contrary to all my expectations, at college I have a very busy schedule with classes from 9 AM to 4 PM, apart from assignments, projects, etc.</p>

<p style="font-size:150%;">I expected that at college I will have access to large playground with lush green grass. At college there are sports grounds but not as good as expected.</p>

<p style="font-size:150%;">I expected the gender ratio would be quiet good at college. So that I can make some female friends. But to my utmost disappointment, the gender ratio is really poor at my college.</p>
<p style="color:brown; font-size:200%;">4.Coding</p>

<p style="font-size:150%;">I thought coding would be a cakewalk and very soon, I would come up with apps designed by me. But to my disappointment, coding  is not easy. It takes a great deal of practice.</p>
